# 1.Introduction

Our main task is to create a mobile application for NSBM Green University premises by considering the current challenges that the students are facing. There are so many areas that we considered during this time period. According to our analysis we ended up identifying these problems. In our application there are four main features and they covered the identified problems.
1. As a newcomer, we have trouble enrolling for students’ clubs, communities, associations, etc. 
2. Every day we have to see the TV display to check for the lecture hall allocation.
3. There is a manual process for study room reservation. So we waste a lot of time on it.
4. If the students have some ideas for improvements or have complaints there is no way to send that in anonymously

By analyzing the problems identified earlier, we found solutions to them. 
1. As a newcomer, we have trouble enrolling for students’ clubs, communities, associations, etc. We added a feature called “Club Enrollment”. Here, we display all the information that is related to the clubs, communities of the faculty of computing. And we have the option to enroll for the communities as you prefer. Considering club association details you can define that club or clubs you like to join. By filling the google form you can submit your enrollment application.
2. Every day we have to see the TV display to check for the lecture hall allocation.Our daily time table schedule displayed on the Tv screen that was located in the entrance of the faculty of computing. Each student as well as lecturers also have to watch that screen to know about the lecture hall that the lecture conducts. So, considering this, we add a feature to our mobile application that students can view what 
is their lecture hall. Here we display the daily lecture hall reservation time table. as well as students can view the time table of other batches. 
3. There is a manual process for study room reservation. So we waste a lot of time on it. In the manual process, we have to fill out the form and sign it from the dean or a lecturer of the faculty of computing. After that process, we handed over that form to the system administrator and received the hall number from her/him. But our application provides that facility. You have to submit the filled form by clicking the available lecture hall from the displayed lecture hall of the application.
4. If the students have some ideas for improvements or have complaints there is no way to send that in anonymously.especially from this feature you can contact the faculty about your problem. If you have trouble with any problem, you can contact the lecturer or anyone in the faculty of computing by sending mail. But here you can send any kind of feedback anonymously. We are not tracking your information.

# 2.Features

 ● **Club/Community Enrollment:**
Students who struggle to find information about the various clubs and communities within the Faculty of Computing (FOC) are helped by the UNITY WORLD mobile app. Students have access to a thorough platform atthis facility that provides information about each community's administrative leaders (master in charge, president, secretary, etc.). Additionally, students can enroll for and join the communities that interest them. This feature also alerts students to upcoming community-organized events, making sure they don't miss out on any opportunities.

 ● **Daily Schedule Display:**
Normally, for information about the lecture halls for their lectures, students have had to look at the TV screens on the ground floor. However, by including the daily schedule right on the app, the UNITY WORLD mobile application facilitates this procedure. The schedule that would typically be shown on the TV screens is easily accessible to students. The app also makes it convenient to access the timetable for each batch, guaranteeing that students can easily and quickly access their lecture schedules.

 ● **Study Room Reservation Facility:**
Students frequently find it inconvenient to reserve study rooms. In order to make a reservation, students typically had to fill out a form the morning of the day they needed a study room. The UNITY WORLD mobile app makes this procedure a lot quicker and more effective. Even a day before they actually need one, students can reserve study rooms. Students can easily reserve a study room by filling out the appropriate form and sending it through the app. The app displays the information, including the time period for which it has been reserved, if a desired study room has already been reserved. This allows students to make appropriate plans.

 ● **Request and Feedback Facility:**
Many students often hesitate to request things they need for their education, make requests, or offer feedback on various resources and services. This problem is addressed by the UNITY WORLD mobile app, which provides a forum for students to post anonymous feedback. This setting promotes open communication among students, which helps to address any issues and enhance the overall learning environment. Students' requests, comments, and suggestions can be submitted, ensuring that their voices are heard and valued.The UNITY WORLD mobile application aims to improve the student experience within the Faculty of Computing by facilitating open communication between students and faculty, facilitating convenient access to information, and simplifying administrative procedures.
